## Week 03 challenge

For this week, we'll see an exploration of linked lists and the benefits of using linked nodes when creating data structures. Subsequently, we will acquire knowledge on the subject of queues, which are based on the FIFO data structure (first in, first out), and the FCFS process scheduling algorithm (first come, first serve). Further to this, we will gain an understanding of stacks, based on the LIFO (last in, first out) data structure, as well as the LCFS process scheduling algorithm (last come, first serve). You can see an explanation here: https://www.loom.com/share/8dd7263643b644e2babc7da216f57e8e
- week 03:
  - Copy the Code_Interview_Linked_Queue_Stacks.ipynb file, create Solution_Code_Interview_Linked_Queue_Stacks.ipynb and read the challenges
  - On the field "Write your code", create the solution to the problems
  - The solution proposed needs to pass all tests
  - The focus for the solution, in this case, was not on memory eficience
