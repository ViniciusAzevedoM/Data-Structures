## Week 04 challenge

This week, we'll explore recursion, binary trees, and other related topics. By the conclusion, we'll have the ability to distinguish between iteration and recursion, construct a binary search tree for querying datasets, and acquire additional skills and knowledge. The challenge and solution you'll find in Week_4_Code_Interview_recursion.ipynb.
